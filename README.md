## Lucifer-The-Ultimate-A.I.

Hi, I am Raghav Atris and I am glad to present my artificial intelligence virtual voice assistant, Lucifer The Ultimate A.I.
It can do a lot of things and automate your daily tasks you do on your personal computers/laptops.

Lucifer Is a Python language-based A.I voice assistant using Speech Application Programming Interface which provides many different functions to one and all.
Lucifer is a A.I dedicated to help people in reduction of human effort. It can perform various tasks presented to it.
It was created after studying the different uses of A.I.

Artificial Intelligence when used with machines, it shows us the capability of thinking like humans. In this, a computer system is designed in such a way that typically requires interaction from human. The instructions for the assistant can be handled as per the requirement of user. It became easier to search google without opening the browser and performing many other daily tasks like playing music, opening your favorite Applications with the help of a single voice command. In the current scenario, advancement in technologies are such that they can perform any task with same effectiveness or can say more effectively than us. 

As the voice assistant is using Artificial Intelligence hence the result that it is providing are highly accurate and efficient. The assistant can help to reduce human effort and consumes time while performing any task, they removed the concept of typing completely and behave as another individual to whom we are talking and asking to perform task. The assistant is no less than a human assistant but we can say that this is more effective and efficient to perform any task. The libraries and packages used to make this assistant focuses on the time complexities and reduces time.

## Real Life Application
- Lucifer is a desktop voice assistant which works on the voice command offered to it, it can do voice searching, voice-activated device control.
- Conversational interaction: It makes it easier to complete any task as it automatically do it by using the essential module or libraries of Python, in a conversational interaction way. Hence any user when instruct any task to it, they feel like giving task to a human assistant because of the conversational interaction for giving input and getting the desired output in the form of task done.
- Reactive nature: The desktop assistant is reactive which means it know human language very well and understand the context that is provided by the user and gives response in the same way, i.e. human understandable language, English. So user finds its reaction in an informed and smart way.
- Multitasking: The main application of it can be its multitasking ability. It can ask for continuous instruction one after other until the user “QUIT” it.
- No Trigger phase: It asks for the instruction and listen the response that is given by user without needing any trigger phase and then only executes the task.
